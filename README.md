# Drupal 9 `drupal-check` Module Project Index Report

A report of the state of all [Module Project Index modules](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module/index?project-status=full&drupal_core=7234) utilizing the tool [drupal-check](https://github.com/mglaman/drupal-check) a "static analysis tool that will check for correctness (e.g. using a class that doesn't exist), deprecation errors, and more." The purpose is to expose our readiness for Drupal 9 a full 15 months ahead of the arrival of Drupal 9, which is scheduled for June 2, 2019.


## How do I use this repo?

Inside the FilesContainingKeywordReports folder you can find all 6,868 text files generated by running [`drupal-check` ](https://github.com/mglaman/drupal-check) using the script [`d9-drupal-check-all.sh`](https://github.com/mcdwayne/Drupal-9-Drupal-Check-Report-Files/blob/master/d9-drupal-check-all.sh).

Reports from my initial report [using this script based on `grep`](https://github.com/mcdwayne/Drupal-9-Drupal-Check-Report-Files/blob/master/quick-stats-tool-for-d9-readiness.sh) was made to seek the most common errors as reported [Deprecation Error Solutions
 wiki portion of the `drupal-check` project page.](https://github.com/mglaman/drupal-check/wiki/Deprecation-Error-Solutions) are published below:

## What can I do?

Read this:

### Contributor or Module Maintainer?
[Read this guide and plan a course of action](https://github.com/mglaman/drupal-check/wiki/Drupal-9-Readiness)

### Drupal user?  

Track progress of your favorite modules on [Drupal.org ticketing](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search?issue_tags=Drupal%209%20compatibility)
If you don't see a ticket concerning the modules you rely on, raise an issue.  

#### What we did at MidCamp 2019

We opened [tickets after running the report on the most popular 300 modules by number of installs](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search?issue_tags=Drupal%209%20compatibility)

[Worksheet I worked from](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-W0k4vhdmw7ugzRdSa9orEc43_D5l6PPvUcrB8bw_-0/edit#gid=1026773715) 


### Why are we documenting 'No Errors'?

Ultimately, seeing if a module is Drupal 9 compatible rely on [an API call, so adding this `drupalci.yml`](https://gist.github.com/josephdpurcell/1c78367cedc15a075e4231a5a685ced9) to the module now means it will be ready!
