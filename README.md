A report of the state of all [Module Project Index listed sites](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module/index?project-status=full&drupal_core=7234) utilizing the tool [drupal-check](https://github.com/mglaman/drupal-check) a "static analysis tool that will check for correctness (e.g. using a class that doesn't exist), deprecation errors, and more."
